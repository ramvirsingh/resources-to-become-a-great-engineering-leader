# 100+ Resources to become a great engineering leader

**List of books, newsletters, people and more!**

Investing in yourself is a great investment anytime! I am sharing with you my personally curated resources to level up and grow to become a great engineering leader in 2025!

I’ve been continuously curating them for over 5 years now.

Topics span from software engineering, system design, data engineering, leadership, management, and all the way to AI and product and business.

## How to start?

There are a LOT of resources here, and your time is very important. I don’t suggest trying to learn all of the resources at once; I suggest picking a few resources at a time from specific categories that you need the most. That’s what I do as well.

When I need to go into more detail in a specific category, I choose the resources and do a deep dive into the specific topics. I also connect with certain individuals, check their posts, and/or ask them questions.

Important: Before you choose which resources you wish to go into more detail, I suggest doing a retrospective of your current skill set and defining where you need to improve.

To help you with finding out what skills you need, this is a great article: [Become a Great Engineering Leader in 2025](https://newsletter.eng-leadership.com/p/become-a-great-engineering-leader).

And for a full roadmap to break into Engineering Leadership, check this article: [Full Roadmap to Break Into Engineering Leadership in 2025](https://newsletter.eng-leadership.com/p/full-roadmap-to-break-into-engineering)

This will ensure you are spending your time on the most impactful things first!
